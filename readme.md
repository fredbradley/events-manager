# About this Repository
On 14th November, [WP Events Manager Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/) released an update (5.8) [which broke broke some aspects of people's post excerpts](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-issues-since-latest-update/). 

This is a download of Version 5.7.3 for people to roll back on that I had saved from a backup before I updated.

Please note, I don't intend to keep this repository going after Events Manager have released a future version with a fix. So please check back at https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/ if there is a newer version than `5.8`.
